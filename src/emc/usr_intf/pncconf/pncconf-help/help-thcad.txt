QtPlasmaC THCAD Setup Page

Model:
Select the model of the THCAD from one of 5, 10, or 300.

F Jumper:
Select the F jumper setting from one of 1, 32, 64, or 128.

0V Frequency & Full Scale Frequency:
Enter the zero volt frequency and the full scale frequency exactly as 
displayed on the calibration sticker on the THCAD card.

Divider Ratio:
For the arc voltage encoder, the divider ratio may be entered as a divider
ratio or as a series resistance.
If using a plasma machine with a CNC port and it has an onboard divider with 
a ratio of 20:1 then enter 20.
If using the full arc voltage with a series resistance then enter the total 
value of resistance in ohms. 2MegOhm would be entered as 2000000.
